what to do with pre-installed gems?
  => create a tarball out of debian/rubinius/var/lib/gems/rubinius and install it somewhere
  => during postinst, unpack that tarball at /var/lib/gems/rubinius unless it already exists
  => or just not install them?

solve the issue with external libraries in vm/external_libs/
  => some of them are in Debian, we should use them instead
  => some others do not appear to be in Debian

register with update-alternatives on postinst

move documentation out of /usr/lib

  => to a new package rubinius-doc ?

export build system patches to debian/patches

how to deal with the bundled rake?

Rubinius does not provide /usr/bin/erb !!
